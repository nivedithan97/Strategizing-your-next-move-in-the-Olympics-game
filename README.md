# Strategizing-your-next-move-in-the-Olympics-game

Olympics games are taken seriously by many countries and athletes put in so much effort to win the Olympics. Along with the preparation of Olympics participants, it is also important to understand the trend in the number of medals won in each country as well as in each sport. Additional information such as gender, height and weight can also be taken into account when analysing the winning probability. Getting hold of this massive amount of information gives the country a competitive edge when it comes to maximising their chances of winning.
